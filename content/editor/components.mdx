# Components

Components are reusable building blocks. You design a component once and place instances across multiple pages. When you edit the master component, all instances update automatically.

## Creating a Component

<Steps>

### Select layers

Select one or more layers in the Layers panel or on the canvas. The selection becomes the component content.

### Create the component

Press <KeyboardShortcut keys="Opt+Cmd+K" /> or right-click and choose **Create Component** from the context menu.

### Name the component

Enter a name in the Create Component dialog. The component is added to your component library and the selection is replaced with an instance.

</Steps>

## Component Variables

Components support variables for content that varies per instance:

- **Text** — Overridable text content
- **Image** — Overridable image source
- **Link** — Overridable link URL

You define variables when creating or editing the component. Each instance can override these values without affecting the master or other instances.

## Editing Components

Double-click any component instance to enter **edit mode**. The canvas shows only the component content. Changes you make apply to the master component and propagate to all instances.

Exit edit mode by clicking outside the component or using the breadcrumb navigation to return to the page.

## Detaching Components

To break the link between an instance and the master, select the instance and press <KeyboardShortcut keys="Opt+Cmd+B" /> or use the context menu **Detach Component**. The instance is replaced with inline layers. Those layers no longer update when the master changes.

<Callout type="warning" title="Irreversible">
Detaching is irreversible. The detached layers are independent copies. You cannot reattach them to the component.
</Callout>

## Instances

Every placement of a component is an instance. Instances share the same structure and styles as the master. You can override component variables per instance. All instances update when you edit the master.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Use components for repeated patterns: headers, footers, cards, buttons, and navigation. Component variables let you customize content while keeping structure and styling consistent.
