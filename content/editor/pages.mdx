# Pages

Pages are the top-level routes of your site. You create and manage them from the **Pages** tab in the left sidebar. Each page has its own URL, settings, and content.

## Creating a Page

<Steps>

### Open the Pages tab

Click the **Pages** tab in the left sidebar to view the page tree.

### Add a new page

Click **Add Page** and choose the page type. Enter a name and configure the slug and other settings in the dialog.

### Configure settings

After creation, you configure the page in the right sidebar under **Settings** when the page is selected, or via the page context menu.

</Steps>

## Page Types

**Regular** — A standard page with a static URL slug. Use this for most content pages such as About, Contact, or landing pages.

**Dynamic** — A template page driven by CMS collection data. The slug uses placeholders (for example, `/blog/{{slug}}`) that resolve to collection item fields. One dynamic page generates many URLs, one per collection item.

**Error** — Special pages for HTTP error responses: 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Server Error). You customize the content and design of these error screens.

## Page Settings

Access page settings by selecting the page in the Layers panel or from the Pages tab context menu. Settings are grouped into:

**General** — Page name, URL slug, folder assignment, and whether the page is an index page for its folder.

**SEO** — Meta title, meta description, social sharing image, and noindex option for search engines.

**Custom Code** — Head and body code injection. Use this for page-specific scripts, styles, or meta tags.

**Auth** — Password protection. When enabled, visitors must enter a password to view the page.

## Folders and Page Tree

Organize pages in folders. Folders create URL segments and help you structure the page tree. You can nest folders and move pages between them by dragging in the Pages tab.

The page tree reflects your site structure. Use it to see relationships between pages and to reorder or reorganize routes.

## Duplicating and Deleting

**Duplicate** — Right-click a page in the Pages tab and choose **Duplicate**. The new page copies all content, settings, and structure. You can then rename it and adjust the slug.

**Delete** — Right-click a page and choose **Delete**.

<Callout type="warning" title="Permanent action">
Deleting a page is permanent. All content and settings are removed. Duplicate the page first if you want to preserve a backup.
