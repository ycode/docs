# Webhooks

Send event data to external URLs when actions occur in your Ycode project. Webhooks use HMAC-SHA256 signing so you can verify requests are authentic.

## Setting Up Webhooks

1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Webhooks**
3. Click **Add Webhook**
4. Enter the target URL
5. Select event types and optional filters
6. Optionally configure a signing secret for HMAC verification

## Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| form.submitted | Triggered when a form is submitted |
| collection.item.created | Triggered when a new collection item is created |
| collection.item.updated | Triggered when a collection item is updated |
| collection.item.deleted | Triggered when a collection item is deleted |

## Filters

Narrow webhook delivery to specific resources:

| Filter | Applies To | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| form_id | form.submitted | Only receive submissions for this form |
| collection_id | collection.item.* | Only receive events for this collection |

## Payload Format

Each webhook sends a JSON payload in the request body. The payload includes:

- **event** — Event type (e.g. `form.submitted`)
- **timestamp** — ISO 8601 timestamp
- **data** — Event-specific data (form fields, item fields, etc.)

Example for `form.submitted`:

```json
{
  "event": "form.submitted",
  "timestamp": "2025-02-16T12:00:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "form_id": "abc123",
    "submission_id": "xyz789",
    "fields": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "Jane Doe"
    }
  }
}
```

## HMAC-SHA256 Signing

When you set a signing secret, Ycode signs each request with HMAC-SHA256. The signature is sent in a header (typically `X-Webhook-Signature` or `X-Signature`). Verify it on your server:

1. Compute HMAC-SHA256 of the raw request body using your secret
2. Compare the result with the signature header
3. Reject the request if they do not match

<Callout type="warning" title="Verification">
Always verify the HMAC signature before processing webhook payloads. Unverified requests could be forged by attackers.
</Callout>

## Delivery and Retries

Webhook delivery is logged. Failed deliveries are retried according to the configured policy. Check delivery logs in the webhook settings to debug issues.

## Testing

Use the **Test** button in webhook settings to send a test payload to your URL. The test uses the same payload format and signing as real events so you can verify your endpoint works correctly.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Return a 2xx status code quickly to acknowledge receipt. Process the payload asynchronously to avoid timeouts.
</Callout>
