# Integrations

Connect Ycode with external services and automate workflows. Integrations are organized into three areas.

## Apps

Connect third-party applications like MailerLite to your Ycode project. App integrations automate data flow between Ycode forms and external services.

## Webhooks

Send event data to external URLs when forms are submitted or collection items change. Configure event types, filters, and HMAC signing for secure verification.

[Webhooks documentation](/docs/integrations/webhooks)

## API

Create API keys for programmatic access to the public v1 API. Use keys to read collections, items, forms, and submissions from your own applications.
