# Integrations

Connect Ycode with external services and automate workflows. Integrations include webhooks, API keys, and direct app connections.

## Webhooks

Send event data to external URLs when forms are submitted or collection items change. Configure event types, filters, and HMAC signing for secure verification.

[Webhooks documentation](/integrations/webhooks)

## MailerLite

Connect forms to MailerLite subscriber groups. Map form fields to MailerLite fields and add new subscribers automatically on form submission.

[MailerLite documentation](/integrations/mailer-lite)

## API Keys

Create API keys for programmatic access to the public v1 API. Use keys to read collections, items, forms, and submissions from your own applications.

## Planned Integrations

Mailchimp, Zapier, and Make integrations are planned for future releases.
