## Connecting Forms to Subscriber Groups

After setup, connect each form to a MailerLite subscriber group:

1. Open the form in the form builder or form settings
2. Go to the **Integrations** or **Actions** section
3. Select MailerLite as the integration
4. Choose the subscriber group to add new signups to
5. Map form fields to MailerLite fields

## Field Mapping

Map form fields to MailerLite subscriber data:

| MailerLite Field | Required | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Email | Yes | Subscriber email address |
| Name | No | Full name or first/last |
| Custom fields | No | Any custom fields in your MailerLite account |

Select the form field that provides each value. Ensure the email field is mapped so subscribers can be added correctly.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Create matching custom fields in MailerLite before mapping. Unmapped form fields are ignored.
