# API Keys

Create and manage API keys for authenticating requests to the public v1 API. API keys provide programmatic access to collections, forms, and submissions.

## Creating an API Key

1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to **Integrations** > **API Keys**
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Copy the generated key immediately

<Callout type="warning" title="One-time display">
The full API key is shown only once at creation. Store it securely. If you lose it, you must create a new key and revoke the old one.
</Callout>

## Key Format

API keys use a 64-character hexadecimal string, often with a prefix (e.g. `ycode_`). Keys are stored as SHA-256 hashes; the plain value is never stored or displayed again.

## Using API Keys

Include the API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://your-project.ycode.dev/ycode/api/v1/collections
```

All v1 API endpoints require this header. Requests without a valid key return 401 Unauthorized.

## Permissions

API keys grant access to the public v1 API:

- List and read collections and items
- List and read forms and submissions
- Create form submissions (POST)

Access is scoped to the project. Keys do not grant access to the Ycode dashboard or admin functions.

## Last Used Tracking

Each key records `last_used_at` when it is used for a request. Check this in the API Keys settings to identify unused keys and rotate them.

## Revoking Keys

Revoke an API key at any time from the API Keys settings page. Revoked keys stop working immediately. Any application using the key will receive 401 responses until you provide a new key.

<Callout type="info" title="Security">
Rotate keys periodically and revoke keys that may have been exposed. Use separate keys per environment (development, staging, production) when possible.
