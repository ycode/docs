# Deployment

Ycode sites are self-hosted on Vercel with Supabase as the backend. You publish content from draft to live and manage domains and redirects.

## Setup Wizard

New projects use a setup wizard at `/ycode/welcome`. The wizard guides you through:

- Connecting to Vercel
- Configuring Supabase
- Initial project setup

Complete the wizard before publishing.

## Publishing Flow

Content uses a draft-to-published workflow:

1. Edit pages, components, and CMS content in draft mode
2. Preview changes in the editor
3. Click **Publish** when ready
4. Published content goes live on your deployment

Draft changes are not visible to visitors until you publish. You can unpublish to revert to the previous published state.

## Cache Revalidation

Ycode supports cache revalidation for static and dynamic content. Configure a `REVALIDATE_SECRET` environment variable in Vercel. When content is published, Ycode triggers revalidation so the live site reflects updates quickly.

## Custom Domains

Connect your own domain to replace the default `*.ycode.dev` or `*.vercel.app` URL.

[Custom domains documentation](/deployment/custom-domains)

## Redirects

Manage URL redirects for moved pages, vanity URLs, and legacy paths.
