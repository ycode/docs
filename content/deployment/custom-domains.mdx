# Custom Domains

Connect your own domain name to your Ycode website. Custom domains are configured in the Vercel dashboard.

## Adding a Custom Domain

1. Open your project in the Vercel dashboard
2. Go to **Settings** > **Domains**
3. Enter your domain (e.g. `www.example.com` or `example.com`)
4. Follow the DNS configuration instructions

Vercel validates domain ownership and provisions an SSL certificate automatically.

## DNS Configuration

Point your domain to Vercel by adding the DNS records shown in the dashboard. Typical setup:

- **A record** — Points the root domain to Vercel's IP
- **CNAME record** — Points `www` (or another subdomain) to your Vercel project

Exact records depend on your DNS provider. Copy the values from the Vercel domain settings.

## SSL Certificates

Vercel provisions and renews SSL certificates automatically. All traffic is served over HTTPS. No manual certificate management is required.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours. Use the Vercel dashboard to check domain status and troubleshoot issues.
