# Redirects

Set up URL redirects for moved pages, legacy URLs, and vanity links. Redirects are managed in project settings.

## Adding Redirects

1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Redirects**
3. Click **Add Redirect**
4. Enter the source path (the URL visitors request)
5. Enter the destination path (where they are sent)
6. Select the redirect type (301 or 302)
7. Save

## Redirect Types

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 301 Permanent | The page has permanently moved. Search engines transfer ranking signals to the new URL |
| 302 Temporary | The page is temporarily at a different location. Use for maintenance or A/B tests |

## Use Cases

- **Renamed pages** — Redirect old URLs to new ones after restructuring
- **Legacy links** — Preserve links from old marketing campaigns or external sites
- **Vanity URLs** — Short or memorable paths that redirect to longer destinations
- **Trailing slashes** — Normalize URLs with or without trailing slashes

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Prefer 301 for permanent moves. Use 302 when the move is temporary so search engines keep indexing the original URL.
