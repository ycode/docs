# Getting Started

Learn how to install, configure, and build your first site with Ycode.

Ycode is an open-source visual website builder powered by Next.js, React, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. You can run it locally for development or deploy it to production on Vercel and Supabase.

## Deployment Options

You have two ways to get Ycode running:

**1. Vercel deployment (recommended for production)**

Deploy your fork of Ycode on Vercel and connect it to a Supabase project. This gives you a live site with automatic deployments from Git. Best for production sites and teams.

**2. Local development**

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the dev server on your machine. Best for experimenting, contributing, or running Ycode on your own infrastructure.

## What You Need

- Node.js 18 or later
- A Supabase project (free tier works)
- Git and npm
- A Vercel account (for production deployment)

## Next Steps
