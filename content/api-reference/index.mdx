# REST API Reference

The Ycode public v1 API provides programmatic access to collections, items, forms, and submissions. Use it to build custom integrations, sync data, or power external applications.

## Base URL

```
https://your-project.ycode.dev/ycode/api/v1
```

Replace `your-project` with your project subdomain or custom domain.

## Authentication

All requests require a Bearer token (API key) in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Create API keys in project settings under **Integrations** > **API Keys**. Invalid or missing keys return 401 Unauthorized.

## Request Format

- **Content-Type**: `application/json` for request bodies
- **Accept**: `application/json` for responses

## Response Format

Successful responses return JSON. List endpoints include pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "total": 42,
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 20
  }
}
```

Single-resource endpoints return the resource directly or wrapped in a `data` key depending on the endpoint.

## Error Handling

Errors return appropriate HTTP status codes with a JSON body:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found."
  }
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 400 | Bad Request — Invalid parameters or body |
| 401 | Unauthorized — Missing or invalid API key |
| 403 | Forbidden — Valid key but insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found — Resource does not exist |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity — Validation failed |
| 500 | Server Error — Internal error |
