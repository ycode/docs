# Form Builder

You create forms visually by adding form elements as layer templates. The form acts as a container with a unique ID; inputs, textareas, selects, and other fields go inside it.

## Adding a Form

1. Drag a **Form** element onto your canvas
2. Add form fields inside the form container (input, textarea, select, checkbox, radio, label)
3. Configure each field's properties in the right panel

The form element has `settings.id` that identifies it for submissions and integrations. Ensure each form on a page has a unique ID.

## Form Elements

Form elements are layer templates you nest inside the form container:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **form** | Container with `settings.id`; wraps all form fields |
| **input** | Single-line input; type is configurable |
| **textarea** | Multi-line text input |
| **select** | Dropdown selection |
| **checkbox** | Boolean toggle |
| **radio** | Single choice from options |
| **label** | Label text for a field |

## Input Types

The input element supports these types via its settings:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **text** | Single-line text |
| **number** | Numeric input |
| **password** | Masked input for passwords |
| **email** | Email address |
| **tel** | Phone number |
| **url** | URL |
| **date** | Date picker |
| **datetime-local** | Date and time picker |
| **range** | Slider with min/max values |

## Form Settings

Configure form behavior in the form element settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **success_action** | `message` or `redirect` — what happens after a successful submission |
| **success_message** | Text shown when `success_action` is `message` |
| **error_message** | Text shown when submission fails |
| **redirect_url** | URL to redirect to when `success_action` is `redirect` |
| **email_notification** | Object with `enabled`, `to`, `subject` for sending emails on submit |

### Success Action

- **message** — Display `success_message` to the user; form stays on the page
- **redirect** — Navigate to `redirect_url` after submission

### Email Notifications

When `email_notification.enabled` is true, Ycode sends an email on each submission:

- **to** — Recipient email address
- **subject** — Email subject line

The email typically includes the submitted field values.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Use the redirect option to send users to a thank-you page or a confirmation URL. Use the message option for quick feedback without leaving the page.
</Callout>

## Validation

Each field can have validation rules:

- **Required** — Field must have a value before submit
- **Minimum/maximum length** — For text and textarea
- **Pattern matching** — Regex for custom formats
- **Custom error messages** — Shown when validation fails

Configure validation in the field's settings. Invalid submissions are blocked and the error message is shown to the user.
