# Ycode Documentation

Welcome to Ycode. Ycode is an open-source visual website builder that gives you full control over your site. Think of it as an alternative to Wix or Squarespace that you host yourself. You get a drag-and-drop editor, a built-in CMS, forms, and more, without vendor lock-in.

Ycode is built with Next.js, React, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS. You deploy it on Vercel and Supabase, so you own your data and infrastructure. No monthly SaaS fees, no limits on pages or visitors.
