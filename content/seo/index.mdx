# SEO Settings

Control how your site appears in search results and when shared on social media. Ycode provides per-page and global SEO settings.

## Per-Page SEO

Each page has its own SEO configuration:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Title | Page title shown in search results and browser tabs. Supports field variables for dynamic pages |
| Description | Meta description for search snippets. Supports field variables |
| Image | Social sharing image. Use an asset or a field variable for dynamic pages |
| Noindex | When enabled, instructs search engines not to index the page |

Use field variables (e.g. `{{title}}`, `{{description}}`) in title and description for collection item pages so each item gets unique metadata.

## Global SEO Settings

Configure site-wide defaults in project settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Google Site Verification | Meta tag value for Google Search Console |
| Global Canonical URL | Base URL for canonical links |
| GA Measurement ID | Google Analytics 4 measurement ID |
| Favicon Asset | Favicon for browser tabs |
| Web Clip Asset | Apple touch icon for home screen |

## Open Graph and Twitter Cards

Ycode generates Open Graph and Twitter Card metadata from your page settings. When you share a link, social platforms use:

- Title
- Description
- Image

Canonical URLs are included to avoid duplicate content issues.

## Sitemap and Robots

Ycode automatically generates:

- **sitemap.xml** — Lists all published pages for search engines
- **robots.txt** — Instructs crawlers which paths to index or exclude

These files update when you publish or unpublish pages. No manual configuration is required for basic setups.

## Custom Code for Structured Data

Inject custom code in the head or body for structured data (JSON-LD). Use this for:

- Organization schema
- Article schema
- Product schema
- Breadcrumb lists
- Other schema.org types

Add your JSON-LD script in the custom code section. Field variables work in custom code so you can output item-specific structured data on dynamic pages.

Use unique titles and descriptions for each page. Avoid duplicate content by varying meta descriptions and using canonical URLs.
