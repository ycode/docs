# Collections

Collections are structured data tables that define the schema for your dynamic content. You create a collection, add fields, and then add items that store values in those fields.

## Creating a Collection

1. Navigate to the **CMS** section in the editor sidebar
2. Click **Add Collection**
3. Name your collection (e.g., "Blog Posts", "Team Members", "Products")

## Built-in Fields

Every collection includes these built-in fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | Unique identifier for each item |
| `name` | Display name for the item |
| `slug` | URL-friendly identifier; often used for dynamic page URLs |
| `created_at` | Timestamp when the item was created |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp when the item was last updated |

You use these fields without defining them. The slug field is commonly used as the source for dynamic page URLs.

## Field Types

You add custom fields to define the structure of your content. Field types are grouped by category:

### Basic

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **text** | Single-line text |
| **rich_text** | Formatted content with the rich text editor |
| **number** | Numeric values |
| **boolean** | True/false toggle |
| **date** | Date and time values |
| **color** | Color picker value |

### Contact

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **email** | Email address |
| **phone** | Phone number |
| **link** | URL or link |

### Assets

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **image** | Image upload; supports multiple files when `data.multiple: true` |
| **audio** | Audio file upload; supports multiple files when `data.multiple: true` |
| **video** | Video file upload; supports multiple files when `data.multiple: true` |
| **document** | Document upload; supports multiple files when `data.multiple: true` |

### Relations

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **reference** | Link to a single item in another collection |
| **multi_reference** | Link to multiple items in another collection |

## Field Properties

Each field has configurable properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Name** | Display label shown in the editor |
| **Slug** | API identifier used when binding data or querying; must be unique within the collection |
| **Required** | When enabled, the field must have a value before saving |
| **Help text** | Optional description shown to content editors |

## Managing Fields

### Adding Fields

1. Open the collection settings
2. Go to the **Fields** section
3. Click **Add Field**
4. Select the field type and configure name, slug, required, and help text

### Reordering Fields

Drag fields in the Fields section to change their order. The order affects how fields appear when editing items.

### Removing Fields

Remove a field from the collection settings. Removing a field does not delete existing values; it only removes the field from the schema. Historical data may remain in the database.

Removing a field can make existing values inaccessible. Export or back up important data before removing fields.

## CSV Import

You can import items from a CSV file:

1. Open the collection
2. Click **Import**
3. Upload your CSV file
4. Map CSV columns to collection fields
5. Start the import

Import runs asynchronously. Column mapping lets you match CSV headers to your field slugs. The system processes rows in the background and updates the collection when done.

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
Ensure your CSV headers match or can be mapped to your field slugs. Use the preview to verify the mapping before importing.
