# Dynamic Pages

Bind collection data to your pages for dynamic, data-driven content.

## What Are Dynamic Pages?

Dynamic pages generate individual pages for each item in a collection. For example, a "Blog Posts" collection can automatically generate a page for each blog post.

## Creating a Dynamic Page

1. Create a new page
2. In page settings, connect it to a collection
3. The page URL will include a dynamic slug from the collection

## Binding Data

Once a page is connected to a collection, you can bind collection fields to elements:

1. Select an element on the canvas
2. In the right panel, find the **Data Binding** option
3. Choose the collection field to display

Text elements, images, links, and other elements can all be bound to collection data.

## Dynamic Lists

To show multiple items on a single page (e.g., a blog listing), use a **Collection List** element. Configure:

- Which collection to display
- How many items to show
- Sort order and filters
